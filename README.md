### Motivation and project description
> This application will be web-based and will be about video games.  It is important to have a database for this so that people can learn more about what kind of video games have had the most success and critical acclaim.  This app will be able to show the end user lists of the top games for each genre based on sales or ratings, it will also be able to show the top games irregardless of genre.  I will have an easy way to interact with the information so that the end user can display and see what they are interested in from the video game database.

### Datasets
> [Video Games Sales Dataset](https://data.world/sumitrock/video-games-sales/workspace/file?filename=Video_Games.csv)  
> This is our dataset.  We chose this dataset because we like video games and we wanted to do a video game related dataset.  It has over 16,000 rows of video games, a separate row for each video game/platform pair.  The attributes include name, platform, year of release, genre, publisher, sales (from na, eu, jp, other, and global), critic count and score, user reviewer count and score, developer, and rating.

### Assessment plan
> + As a user, I want to be able to see the best video games for each genre.
> + As a user, I want to be able to see the best overall video games.
> + As a user, I want to be able to choose the best video game definition metric (By user reviews, critic reviews, or sales).
> + As a developer, I want to create a database that is secure and cannot be SQL injeceted.

### Personnel management

> + Melissa Olhausen - Lead Java Developer
> + Nathaniel Morris - Developer

### Communication
> We will communicate via Discord, maybe we will add a virtual meeting or two if needed.

### Application Description
> + 

1. A description of the application and its features. State as clearly as possible what you want to do (bullet points preferred). This can be extracted from your Checkpoint 1 write-up.

![Our ER Diagram](https://github.com/uiyotp/cs-366-project/raw/master/video-game-sales-ERdiagram.png "Our ER Diagram")


2. The ER diagram of your application domain, plus English description.

Please make sure to specify all entity sets (and their attributes), relationship sets (with key constraints/relationship multiplicities, total participation, referential integrity constraints if applicable), primary keys, weak entities (if any). State any other assumptions you had to make for modeling the ER diagram.

Minimum Requirements: 4 entity sets, 3 relationship sets, primary key attributes being specified on all entities, relationship multiplicities being specified on all relationships (for example, many-many, many-one, one-one).

Your ER diagram must follow your specifications and assumptions. The English description should clearly describe your ER diagram, in particular, the entity sets and the relationship sets in the diagram.

3. A description of the functionalities that you plan to offer. At the minimum, you must handle inserting, deleting, and modifying tuples in the database, as well as handling queries that involve joins (all joins), projections, selections, and aggregations (e.g., sum, average, max, min, etc.). Note: notions such as aggregations will be covered shortly in the class.
4. Specify the kind of queries that will be commonly asked in your application in English and how they match with the functionalities that you plan to offer. For example: if you are developing a database to manage movies and want to provide two features: search, and review. For the search feature, you will provide the functionalities to search by directors, by genres, by star rating and date. For the review feature, you will provide the functionalities to display the average rating for a movie, or to enable users to enter a review for a specific movie.
5. Discuss the planned user interface to your database. At the minimum, this user interface must be a text-based one. It is preferred to be a Web-based or mobile interface.
6. A description of software platforms/languages that you plan to use.
